## Margarita

* 2 oz Tequila blanco or reposado
* 1 oz orange liqueur 
* juice of half lime
* dash of salt
* dash of agave nectar

First off, don't cheap out on the ingredients. Use tequila made from 100% agave or you'll regret it. And at least go one notch up from the bottom shelf orange liqueur. Patron Citronage works well as orange liquer in margaritas and isn't as expensive as Grand Marnier or Cointreau.

Fill a martini glass with ice water. Mix ingredients in cocktail shaker with ice. Shake like hell. Dump ice water, strain mixture into martini glass. Drink while making a second one.

Warning: This is a stiff margarita. For novices, consider using a whole lime instead of half, maybe only 1 oz of tequila, and/or serve over ice.
