## Frozen Banana Daquiri

* 1 cup whole ice cubes
* 1 frozen banana, broken into chunks
* Juice of 1/2 lime
* 1.5 oz golden rum
* .5 oz orange liqueur

Be sure to use frozen bananas, and be sure to peel them before freezing. Put it all in a blender, blend vigorously. Wear sunglasses while blending for safety. For best results, double the recipe. Or quadruple it. Or eight-thruple it. Is that a word? Have a couple of these and it won't matter.
