## Hot Basil Gimlet

* 3 oz gin
* 3 fresh basil leaves
* 12 drops Addition Piri Piri bitters (or whatever spicy pepper bitters you like)
* 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
* dash salt

Muddle juice, bitters, basil, and salt in a mixing glass. Add gin and ice. Shake like hell. Strain through a fine sieve to keep the basil and lime pith out of the glass, and more importantly out of your teeth so you don't embarrass yourself in public again. (You're welcome.) Add more bitters for more heat.
