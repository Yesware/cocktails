## Nobody's Fault

* 2 oz gin
* 0.5 oz st Germaine 
* 0.5 oz sweet vermouth
* 0.5 oz lemon juice
* 2 dash angostura bitters
* Dash simple syrup

Fill a coupe glass with ice. Mix ingredients in a shaker. Dump ice in shaker, shake vigorously while singing the chorus of [Nobody's Fault But Mine by Led Zeppelin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esZ15n6_5JY). Strain through mesh strainer (to remove lemon pith) into coupe glass. Garnish with orange (or lemon or grapefruit) peel. Drink while listening to the rest of the song. [Blind Willie's version] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_o4omd8T5c) is also acceptable.
