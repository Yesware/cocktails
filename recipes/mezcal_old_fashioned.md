## Mezcal Old Fashioned

* Previously juiced lime wedge
* 2 dashes of Agave nectar
* 2 dashes angostura bitters
* 1.5 oz Mezcal

Fill an old-fashioned glass with ice. In a separate mixing glass, muddle lime wedge, agave, and bitters until the lime wedge is as demolished as your hopes and dreams. Add mezcal and ice from other glass. Stir mixture, strain into empty glass. Garnish with lime peel.
