## Dixie Car Bomb

* 1.5 oz bourbon
* 0.5 oz butterscotch schnapps
* 16 oz PBR tall boy

First off, you best go cheap on this. Cheap like an Allston rock city crustpunk getting last call at the Great Scott with the roll of quarters he was gonna use for laundry the next day.

He wasn't gonna do laundry; you're not fooling anyone with your $100 bottle of Four Roses.

Pour yourself a shot of bourbon. Drink. You deserve it.

Pour the schnapps in the shot glass.

Pour the rest of the bourbon over the schnapps.

Crack the PBR. Drain a few ounces (down your esophagus, not the sink - clown).

Using a can opener, cut the top off the tall boy. 10 points to Gryffindor if you do it with your bare hands.

Drop in your shot glass & chug. And just like if you were in Allston, watch your mouth and don't get sliced.
